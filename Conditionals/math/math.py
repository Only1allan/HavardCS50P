"""
In a file called math.py, 
implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression 
and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. 
Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:

    x is an integer
    y is +, -, *, or /
    z is an integer

For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0.

Note that, just as python itself is an interpreter for Python, so will your interpreter.py be an interpreter for math!
